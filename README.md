# This project presents the design and implementation of a Hash-Based Spatio Temporal Apriori Algorithm (HBST), a new state of art Frequent Pattern Mining Algorithm for spatio-temporal datasets. In this work, the number of database accesses is reduced by using Calendar Map Schemas (CMS) which is a direct address-based hashing technique is used to optimize collisions as well as the execution time of the algorithm.
